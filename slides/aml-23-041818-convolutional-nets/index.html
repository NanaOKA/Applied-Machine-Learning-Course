#Keras Sequential

.smaller[
```python
from keras.models import Sequential

Using TensorFlow backend.
```
```python
model = Sequential([
    Dense(32, input_shape=(784,)),
    Activation('relu'),
    Dense(10),
    Activation('softmax')])

# or
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(32, input_dim=784))
model.add(Activation('relu'))

# or
model = Sequential([
    Dense(32, input_shape=(784,), activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')])
```
]


???
There are two interfaces to keras, sequential and the
functional, but we’ll only discuss sequential.
Sequential is for feed-forward neural networks where
one layer follows the other. You specify the layers as
a list, similar to a sklearn pipeline.
Dense layers are just matrix multiplications. Here we
have a neural net with 32 hidden units for the mnist
dataset with 10 outputs. The hidden layer nonlinearity
is relu, the output if softmax for multi-class
classification.
You can also instantiate an empty sequential model
and then add steps to it.
For the first layer we need to specify the input shape
so the model knows the sizes of all the matrices. The
following layers can infer the sizes from the previous
layers.

See https://keras.io/scikit-learn-api/

Useful for grid-search.
You need to define a callable that returns a compiled
model.
You can search parameters that in Keras would be
passed to “fit” like the number of epochs.
Searching over epochs in this way is not necessarily a good idea, though.

res = pd.DataFrame(grid.cv_results_)

Training longer overfits more and more units overfit
more, but both also lead to better results.
We should probably train much longer actually.
Setting the number of epochs via cross-validation is a
bit silly since it means starting from scratch again
each time. Using early stopping would be better.

- https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/JMLRdropout.pdf

- Rate often as high as .5, i.e. 50% of units set to zero!

- Predictions: use all weights, down-weight by rate

???

- Randomly set activations to zero.

Drop out is a very successful regularization technique
developed in 2014. It is an extreme case of adding
noise to the input, a previously established method to
avoid overfitting.
Instead of adding noise, we actually set given inputs to
0. And not only on the input layer, also the
intermediate layer.
For each sample, and each iteration we pick different
nodes. Randomization avoids overfitting to particular
examples.

#Ensemble Interpretation

- Every possible configuration represents different
network.

- With p=.5 we jointly learn `$\binom{n}{n/2}$` networks

- Networks share weights

geometric mean of predictions of sub-networks.

#Definition of Convolution


`$$ (f*g)[n] = \sum\limits_{m=-\infty}^\infty f[m]g[n-m] $$`

`$$ = \sum\limits_{m=-\infty}^\infty f[n-m]g[m] $$`

.center[
![:scale 80%](images/convolution.png)
]

???
The definition is symmetric in f, but usually one is the
input signal, say f, and g is a fixed “filter” that is
applied to it.
You can imagine the convolution as g sliding over f.
If the support of g is smaller than the support of f (it’s
a shorter non-zero sequence) then you can think of it
as each entry in f * g depending on all entries of g
multiplied with a local window in f.
Not that the output is shorter than the input by half the
size of g. this is called a valid convolution.
We could also extend f with zeros, and get a result that
is larger than f by half the size of g, that’s called a
full convolution. We can also just pad a little bit and
get something that is of the same size as f.
Also not that the filter g is flipped as it’s indexed with
-m

???
Here is the architecture of an early convolutional net
form 1998. The basic architecture in current
networks is still the same.
You can multiple layers of convolutions and resampling
operations. You start convolving the image, which
extracts local features. Each convolutions creates
new “feature maps” that serve as input to later
convolutions.
To allow more global operations, after the convolutions
the image resolution is changed. Back then it was
subsampling, today it is max-pooling.
So you end up with more and more feature maps with
lower and lower resolution.
At the end, you have some fully connected layers to do
the classificattion.

Here are two more recent architectures, AlexNet from
2012 and VGG net from 2015.
These nets are typically very deep, but often have very
small convolutions. In VGG there are 3x3
convolutions and even 1x1 convolutions which serve
to summarize multiple feature maps into one.
There is often multiple convolutions without pooling in
between but pooling is definitely essential.

X_train_images = x_train.reshape(x_train.shape[0], img_rows, img_cols, 1)
X_test_images = x_test.reshape(x_test.shape[0], img_rows, img_cols, 1)

y_train = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, num_classes)
y_test = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_test, num_classes)
```
]


???
For convolutional nets the data is n_samples, width,
height, channels.
MNIST has one channel because it’s grayscale. Often
you have RGB channels or possibly Lab.
The position of the channels is configurable, using the
“channels_first” and “channels_last” options – but
you shouldn’t have to worry about that.

# Create Tiny Network

```python
from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten

num_classes = 10
cnn = Sequential()
cnn.add(Conv2D(32, kernel_size=(3, 3),
                 activation='relu',
                 input_shape=input_shape))
cnn.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
cnn.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
cnn.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
cnn.add(Flatten())
cnn.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))
cnn.add(Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax'))
```



???
For convolutional nets we need 3 new layer types:
Conv2d for 2d convolutions, MaxPooling2d for max
pooling and Flatten go reshape the input for a dense
layer.
There are many other options but these are the most
commonly used ones.

???
Another relatively recent advance in neural networks is
batch normalization. The idea is that neural networks
learn best when the input is zero mean and unit
variance. We can scale the data to get that.
But each layer inside a neural network is itself a neural
network with inputs given by the previous layer. And
that output might have much larger or smaller scale
(depending on the activation function).
Batch normalization re-normalizes the activations for a
layer for each batch during training (as the
distribution over activation changes). The avoids
saturation when using saturating functions.
To keep the expressive power of the model, additional
scale and shift parameters are learned that are
applied after the per-batch normalization.
